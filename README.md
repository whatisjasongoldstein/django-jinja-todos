React can use the same component templates that render on both serverside and in Javascript.

Can I make Django do the same using Nunjucks+Jinja2?

Let's start small, TODOMVC style.

## Progress

- [x] Serializing baked into models
- [x] Components render in both Python and Javascript
- [x] JS for editing and updating the ToDo List 
- [x] Adds, updated, and deletes persist to the server
- [ ] JS for filtering the ToDo list
- [ ] Deserializing/saving baked into the model
- [ ] Readonable approach to API's
- [ ] Make code not garbage
- [ ] Minimize boilerplate
- [ ] A second app scope?
